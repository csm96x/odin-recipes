        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>Guanciale</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>  
        <ol>
            <li>First, boil the water for the pasta while you prepare the 
                carbonara sauce. Remember: 1 liter (4 cups) of water for 
                every 100 g (3,50 oz) of pasta and 10 g (~1/2 tablespoon) of 
                corse salt per liter (4 cups) of water.
             </li>
             <li>Cut the guanciale into small pieces (cubes, slicesâ€¦ as you prefer) 
                then cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Stir occasionally so that it cooks evenly. The more the guanciale cooks, 
                the more its fat will melt and its meat will become crispy. 
                The level of cooking is up to you, depending on your taste. 
                Some people like their guanciale well cooked and others prefer it soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now prepare the pecorino cream. So, in a bowl put the eggs and pecorino Romano cheese.
                 Use the whole egg, not only the egg yolk. Add the pepper too and mix.
            </li>  
            <li> Cook the pasta al dente. After that, add it to the pan with the guanciale cubes. 
                When the spaghetti and guanciale sizzle in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT, otherwise the eggs will overcook 
                and you will end up with scrambled eggs and pasta!

                Now quickly add the eggs and pecorino cream to the hot pasta and stir. The pan is not too hot, 
                this way the eggs will cook without lumps.
